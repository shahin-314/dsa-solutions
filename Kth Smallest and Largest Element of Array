### Step 1: Understanding the Problem Statement (Super Simple)
**What‚Äôs the task?**  
- You‚Äôre given:
  - A vector (array) of integers `arr` (e.g., `[7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]`).
  - The size of the array `n` (e.g., 6 for 6 elements).
  - An integer `k` (e.g., 3).
- You need to find:
  - The **kth smallest** element in the array (after sorting in ascending order).
  - The **kth largest** element in the array (after sorting in descending order).
- Return both values as a vector: `[kth_smallest, kth_largest]`.
- **Key Point**: The array may have duplicates, and `k` is 1-based (k=1 means first smallest/largest).

**Sample Example**:  
- **Input**: `arr = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]`, `n = 6`, `k = 3`.  
  - **Sort ascending**: `[3, 4, 7, 10, 15, 20]`.  
    - 1st smallest: 3, 2nd smallest: 4, **3rd smallest**: 7.  
  - **Sort descending**: `[20, 15, 10, 7, 4, 3]`.  
    - 1st largest: 20, 2nd largest: 15, **3rd largest**: 10.  
  - **Output**: `[7, 10]` (3rd smallest = 7, 3rd largest = 10).

**Constraints (Assumed, typical for this problem)**:  
- 1 ‚â§ `k` ‚â§ `n` ‚â§ 10^5 (array size can be large).  
- Array elements can be positive/negative integers, may have duplicates.  
- Time complexity should be efficient (O(n log n) is okay for sorting-based solutions).

**Analogy**:  
- Imagine `arr = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]` as a row of candies with numbers: üçé7, üçå10, üçä4, üçã3, üçç20, üçá15.  
- You want the **3rd smallest** candy (sort candies smallest to largest: üçã3, üçä4, üçé7 ‚Üí pick üçé7).  
- And the **3rd largest** candy (sort largest to smallest: üçç20, üçá15, üçå10 ‚Üí pick üçå10).  
- Return both: `[7, 10]`.

**Why it might feel confusing?**  
- You‚Äôre used to strings (e.g., replace spaces, count characters), but this deals with an array of numbers.  
- Sorting and picking the kth element is new, but it‚Äôs similar to sorting a string in your previous problem.  
- The ‚Äúkth smallest/largest‚Äù concept might feel tricky, but it‚Äôs just about positions after sorting.

---

### Step 2: Connection to Your Previous Questions
- **String Sort**: You used `sort(s.begin(), s.end())` to sort a string. Here, you sort an array of numbers similarly with `sort(arr.begin(), arr.end())`.  
- **Count Characters**: You looped to count letters/digits. Here, you sort and pick specific positions (no counting).  
- **Replace Spaces**: You processed a string character by character. This processes an array but uses sorting instead of a loop.  
- **Sum of Even & Odd Digits**: You worked with numbers. This is similar, but you‚Äôre finding positions, not sums.  
- **Palindrome**: You manipulated sequences. This manipulates an array via sorting.

### Step 3: The Code with Detailed Comments
Here‚Äôs your code with super clear, beginner-friendly comments explaining every step:

#include <algorithm> // Includes sort function
#include <vector>    // For using vector (assumed, since function uses vector)
using namespace std;

vector<int> kthSmallLarge(vector<int> &arr, int n, int k) {
    // Step 1: Sort the array in ascending order (smallest to largest)
    // Example: arr = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15] becomes [3, 4, 7, 10, 15, 20]
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    
    // Step 2: Find kth smallest element (kth position after sorting)
    // k is 1-based, so arr[k-1] gives kth element (0-based index)
    // Example: k = 3, arr[2] = 7 (3rd smallest)
    int kthsmall = arr[k - 1];
    
    // Step 3: Find kth largest element (kth from end after sorting)
    // arr.size() - k gives kth from end (0-based index)
    // Example: k = 3, arr.size() = 6, arr[6-3] = arr[3] = 10 (3rd largest)
    int kthlarge = arr[arr.size() - k];
    
    // Step 4: Return both values as a vector
    // Example: return [7, 10]
    return {kthsmall, kthlarge};
}
</xaiArtifact>

- **Why this code?**  
  - Simple: Uses built-in `sort` to handle sorting, then picks elements by index.  
  - Beginner-friendly: No complex logic, just sorting and indexing.  
  - Correct: Finds kth smallest (kth position) and kth largest (kth from end).  
  - Time: O(n log n) (due to `sort`), Space: O(1) (in-place sort).

**Note**: I added `#include <vector>` since the function uses `vector<int>`. `<algorithm>` is already included for `sort`.

---

### Step 4: Line-by-Line Explanation with Values
Let‚Äôs explain each line using the example input: `arr = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]`, `n = 6`, `k = 3`.  
**Expected Output**: `[7, 10]` (3rd smallest = 7, 3rd largest = 10).

- **Line 1: #include <algorithm>**  
  - Gives access to the `sort` function.  
  - **Purpose**: Allows sorting the array.  
  - **Example**: We‚Äôll use it to sort `[7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]`.

- **Line 2: #include <vector>**  
  - Needed for `vector<int>` (since `arr` is a vector).  
  - **Purpose**: Lets us work with `arr` and return `vector<int>`.  
  - **Example**: `arr` is a vector `[7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]`.

- **Line 3: using namespace std;**  
  - Lets us write `sort` instead of `std::sort`, `vector` instead of `std::vector`.  
  - **Example**: Simplifies code for `sort(arr.begin(), arr.end())`.

- **Line 4: vector<int> kthSmallLarge(vector<int> &arr, int n, int k) {**  
  - Defines a function that:  
    - Takes a vector `arr` (by reference, `&arr`, to avoid copying).  
    - Takes `n` (array size, though not needed since `arr.size()` exists).  
    - Takes `k` (for kth smallest/largest).  
    - Returns a vector of two integers `[kth_smallest, kth_largest]`.  
  - **Example**: Input `arr = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]`, `n = 6`, `k = 3`.

- **Line 5: sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());**  
  - Sorts the vector `arr` in **ascending order** (smallest to largest).  
  - `arr.begin()` points to the first element, `arr.end()` points past the last.  
  - **How it works**: Rearranges `arr` so elements are in order: `[3, 4, 7, 10, 15, 20]`.  
  - **Example**:  
    - Before: `arr = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]`.  
    - After: `arr = [3, 4, 7, 10, 15, 20]`.  
  - **Values**: `arr[0] = 3`, `arr[1] = 4`, `arr[2] = 7`, `arr[3] = 10`, `arr[4] = 15`, `arr[5] = 20`.

- **Line 6: int kthsmall = arr[k - 1];**  
  - Finds the **kth smallest** element.  
  - After sorting, the kth smallest is at index `k-1` (0-based indexing).  
  - **Why k-1?** `k` is 1-based (k=3 means 3rd element), but array indices are 0-based.  
  - **Example**:  
    - `k = 3`, so `k - 1 = 2`.  
    - `arr[2] = 7` (3rd smallest after sorting: 3, 4, **7**, 10, 15, 20).  
  - **Values**: `kthsmall = 7`.

- **Line 7: int kthlarge = arr[arr.size() - k];**  
  - Finds the **kth largest** element.  
  - After sorting in ascending order, the kth largest is at index `arr.size() - k`.  
  - **Why arr.size() - k?**  
    - `arr.size()` is the total number of elements (e.g., 6).  
    - kth largest is kth from the end (e.g., k=3 means 3rd from end).  
    - Index: `6 - 3 = 3`.  
  - **Example**:  
    - `arr.size() = 6`, `k = 3`, so `arr.size() - k = 6 - 3 = 3`.  
    - `arr[3] = 10` (3rd largest: 20, 15, **10**, 7, 4, 3).  
  - **Values**: `kthlarge = 10`.

- **Line 8: return {kthsmall, kthlarge};**  
  - Returns a vector containing the kth smallest and kth largest elements.  
  - **Example**: Returns `{7, 10}` (vector with `[7, 10]`).  
  - **Values**: `[kthsmall, kthlarge] = [7, 10]`.

---

### Step 5: Dry Run (Example: `arr = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]`, `n = 6`, `k = 3`)
Let‚Äôs walk through the code step-by-step with values.

**Initial Input**:  
- `arr = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]` (vector).  
- `n = 6` (size, not used in code since `arr.size()` gives it).  
- `k = 3` (find 3rd smallest and 3rd largest).  
- **Goal**: Return `[7, 10]`.

**Step 1: sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());**  
- Before sorting: `arr = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]`.  
- Sorting in ascending order:  
  - Compare and rearrange elements (C++ handles this internally).  
  - After sorting: `arr = [3, 4, 7, 10, 15, 20]`.  
- **Values**:  
  - `arr[0] = 3`, `arr[1] = 4`, `arr[2] = 7`, `arr[3] = 10`, `arr[4] = 15`, `arr[5] = 20`.

**Step 2: int kthsmall = arr[k - 1];**  
- `k = 3`, so `k - 1 = 2`.  
- `arr[2] = 7` (3rd element in sorted array).  
- **Values**: `kthsmall = 7`.  
- **Check**: Sorted array `[3, 4, 7, 10, 15, 20]` ‚Üí 1st: 3, 2nd: 4, 3rd: 7 (correct).

**Step 3: int kthlarge = arr[arr.size() - k];**  
- `arr.size() = 6` (6 elements).  
- `k = 3`, so `arr.size() - k = 6 - 3 = 3`.  
- `arr[3] = 10` (4th element in sorted array).  
- **Values**: `kthlarge = 10`.  
- **Check**: Sorted array `[3, 4, 7, 10, 15, 20]` in descending order is `[20, 15, 10, 7, 4, 3]` ‚Üí 1st: 20, 2nd: 15, 3rd: 10 (correct).

**Step 4: return {kthsmall, kthlarge};**  
- Creates a vector `{7, 10}`.  
- **Values**: Returns `[7, 10]`.

**Output**: `[7, 10]` (3rd smallest = 7, 3rd largest = 10).

---

### Step 6: Another Example (arr = [1, 2, 2, 3], n = 4, k = 2)
To make it crystal clear, let‚Äôs try a smaller example with duplicates:  
- **Input**: `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]`, `n = 4`, `k = 2`.  
- **Expected Output**: `[2, 2]` (2nd smallest = 2, 2nd largest = 2).

**Dry Run**:  
- **Initial**: `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]`, `k = 2`.  
- **sort(arr.begin(), arr.end())**:  
  - Before: `[1, 2, 2, 3]`.  
  - After: `[1, 2, 2, 3]` (already sorted, duplicates stay).  
- **kthsmall = arr[k - 1]**:  
  - `k = 2`, `k - 1 = 1`.  
  - `arr[1] = 2` (2nd smallest: 1, **2**, 2, 3).  
- **kthlarge = arr[arr.size() - k]**:  
  - `arr.size() = 4`, `k = 2`, `4 - 2 = 2`.  
  - `arr[2] = 2` (2nd largest: 3, **2**, 2, 1).  
- **return {kthsmall, kthlarge}**: Returns `[2, 2]`.

**Output**: `[2, 2]`.

---

### Step 7: Why This Code Works
- **Correctness**:  
  - Sorting puts elements in ascending order, making it easy to find:  
    - kth smallest at index `k-1`.  
    - kth largest at index `arr.size() - k`.  
  - Handles duplicates (e.g., `[1, 2, 2, 3]`).  
  - Returns both values as a vector.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - `k = 1`: 1st smallest = `arr[0]`, 1st largest = `arr[n-1]`.  
  - `k = n`: nth smallest = `arr[n-1]`, nth largest = `arr[0]`.  
  - Duplicates: Handled by sorting (e.g., `[2, 2, 2]` ‚Üí k=2 gives `[2, 2]`).  
  - Single element: `arr = [5]`, `k = 1` ‚Üí `[5, 5]`.  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) (due to `sort`).  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) (in-place sort, excluding output vector).

**Note**: If TLE is an issue (like your previous string sort problem), an O(n) solution using a heap or quickselect is possible, but O(n log n) is typically fine for `n ‚â§ 10^5`. If you‚Äôre getting TLE, share the constraints!

---

### Step 8: Connection to Your Previous Questions
- **String Sort**: You used `sort(s.begin(), s.end())` to sort a string. Here, you use the same `sort` for a vector of integers.  
- **Count Characters**: You counted characters using a loop. Here, you sort and pick elements, no counting needed.  
- **Replace Spaces**: You processed a string character by character. This sorts an array but uses similar indexing (`arr[k-1]`).  
- **Sum of Even & Odd Digits**: You worked with numbers. This finds specific numbers by position after sorting.  
- **Palindrome**: You manipulated sequences. This manipulates an array via sorting.

---

### Step 9: Tips for Beginners
- **Sorting Vectors**: Use `sort(arr.begin(), arr.end())` for ascending order.  
- **Indexing**: Remember `k` is 1-based, but array indices are 0-based (`k-1`).  
- **Debugging**: Print the sorted array:
  ```cpp:disable-run
  sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
  for (int x : arr) cout << x << " ";
  cout << endl;
  ```
- **Test Cases**:  
  - `arr = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]`, `k = 3` ‚Üí `[7, 10]`.  
  - `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]`, `k = 2` ‚Üí `[2, 2]`.  
  - `arr = [5]`, `k = 1` ‚Üí `[5, 5]`.  

---

### Step 10: If You‚Äôre Getting TLE or Wrong Answer
If you‚Äôre facing issues (TLE or wrong answer), it‚Äôs unlikely with this code since O(n log n) is standard for this problem. Possible issues:  
- **TLE**: If `n` is very large (e.g., 10^6), we could use quickselect for O(n) average time (let me know if needed).  
- **Wrong Answer**: Check if `k` is valid (1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ n). The code assumes valid input.  
- **Constraints**: Share the problem constraints or failing test case for a tailored fix.

---

### Step 11: Summary
- **Problem**: Find the kth smallest and kth largest elements in an array, return `[kth_smallest, kth_largest]`.  
- **Code**: Sorts the array (`sort`), picks kth smallest (`arr[k-1]`) and kth largest (`arr[n-k]`), returns as a vector.  
- **Dry Run**: For `arr = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]`, `k = 3`, sorts to `[3, 4, 7, 10, 15, 20]`, returns `[7, 10]`.  
- **Connection**: Like string sort, uses `sort`, but works with numbers and picks specific positions.

If you‚Äôre confused about sorting, indexing (`k-1` vs. `n-k`), or need help with test cases, yaar, tell me, and I‚Äôll explain with more examples or simplify further! You‚Äôre doing great! üòä
