Sure! Let's break down the code and its logic step-by-step, explaining it in simple terms.

### Problem Statement
The task here is to reverse the order of words in a given string while maintaining the original spacing. For example:
- Input: `"Hello World"`
- Output: `"World Hello"`

### Understanding the Code

Here's the code again, with comments added for clarity:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

// Function to reverse the order of words in a string
string reverseString(string &str) {
    // Use istringstream to read words and handle multiple spaces
    istringstream iss(str); // Create a stream from the input string
    vector<string> words;    // Vector to store individual words
    string word;            // Variable to store each word temporarily

    // Extract words from the input string
    while (iss >> word) {   // Read words from the stream
        words.push_back(word); // Add each word to the vector
    }

    // Build the reversed string
    string result;           // To store the final reversed string
    for (int i = words.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) { // Iterate from the last word to the first
        result += words[i];  // Append the word to result
        if (i > 0) result += ' '; // Add a space only if not the last word
    }

    return result;          // Return the final reversed string
}
```

### Code Flow Explained

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function `reverseString` takes a string reference as input.
   - We create an `istringstream` object called `iss` that reads from `str`.
   - We declare a vector `words` to store the individual words and a string `word` to temporarily hold each word.

2. **Extracting Words**:
   - The `while (iss >> word)` line reads words from the string stream. 
     - Here, `iss` is the input stream, and `>> word` extracts a word from the stream.
     - The `while` loop continues until there are no more words to read.
     - Each extracted word is stored in the `words` vector using `words.push_back(word)`.

3. **Building the Reversed String**:
   - We initialize an empty string `result`.
   - We use a `for` loop to iterate backward through the `words` vector. The loop runs from the last index (`words.size() - 1`) to `0`.
   - In each iteration, we append the current word to `result`.
   - If it's not the last word, we add a space to `result`.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns the `result`, which contains the words in reverse order.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's dry-run the code with an example.

#### Example 1
- Input: `"Hello World"`

1. **Extracting Words**:
   - `iss` reads `Hello` -> `word` becomes `"Hello"`
   - `words` becomes `["Hello"]`
   - `iss` reads `World` -> `word` becomes `"World"`
   - `words` becomes `["Hello", "World"]`

2. **Building Reversed String**:
   - Start with an empty `result`.
   - Loop starts from index `1` (last word):
     - `result += words[1]` → `result` becomes `"World"`
     - Add space: `result` is now `"World "`
     - Next, for index `0`: `result += words[0]` → `result` becomes `"World Hello"`

3. **Final Output**:
   - The function returns `"World Hello"`.

#### Example 2
- Input: `"   Hello    World   "` (extra spaces)

1. **Extracting Words**:
   - Only extracts `Hello` and `World`.
   - `words` becomes `["Hello", "World"]`.

2. **Building Reversed String**:
   - Same as before, we get `"World Hello"`.

### Explanation of Specific Lines

- **`while (iss >> word)`**:
  - This line reads words from the string stream `iss`. The `>>` operator extracts words separated by spaces. If there are multiple spaces, they are ignored, and only words are collected.

- **`for (int i = words.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i)`**:
  - This line iterates backward through the `words` vector. `words.size() - 1` gives the index of the last word. The loop continues until `i` is `0`, effectively reversing the order of the words.

### Differences between `word` and `words`
- `word` is a single string variable that temporarily holds the current word being extracted from the input string.
- `words` is a vector that stores all the words extracted from the input string.

### Conclusion

This code efficiently reverses the words in a string while ignoring extra spaces. It uses a string stream for word extraction and a vector to store those words. The process involves reading, storing, and then reconstructing the string in reverse order.
