Let’s break this code step by step and explain how it works, in an easy and systematic manner, just like before.

---

### **What does this code do?**
This code finds the **length of a cycle (loop)** in a linked list. If there’s a loop, it calculates how many nodes are in the cycle.

---

### **How does it work?**
The code has two parts:
1. **Detect the loop**: Use two pointers (`slow` and `fast`) to check if there’s a cycle in the linked list.
2. **Calculate loop length**: If a loop is detected, count the number of nodes in the cycle using another function.

---

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**

#### **1. Detect the Loop**
The function `lengthOfLoop(Node* head)` detects if a loop exists in the linked list:
- Two pointers (`slow` and `fast`) start at the head.
- `slow` moves one step at a time.
- `fast` moves two steps at a time.
- If `slow` and `fast` meet, a loop exists.

---

#### **2. Calculate the Loop Length**
The function `findLengthOfLoopLL(Node* slow, Node* fast)` calculates the loop length:
- Start from the meeting point of `slow` and `fast`.
- Traverse the loop using one pointer (`fast`) until it meets `slow` again.
- Count the number of steps taken.

---

### **Dry Run with Example**

#### **Linked List with a Loop**
Example:
```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
          ^          |
          |----------|
```
Here:
- Node `5` points back to node `3`, forming a loop.

---

#### **Step-by-Step Execution**

**Code Flow:**
1. **Initialization**:
   - `slow = head (1)`
   - `fast = head (1)`

---

**Detect the Loop (`lengthOfLoop`)**:
- **Iteration 1**:
  - `slow = 2`
  - `fast = 3`
- **Iteration 2**:
  - `slow = 3`
  - `fast = 5`
- **Iteration 3**:
  - `slow = 4`
  - `fast = 4` (they meet, loop detected).

At this point, the code calls `findLengthOfLoopLL(slow, fast)`.

---

**Find the Loop Length (`findLengthOfLoopLL`)**:
- Start from the meeting point (`slow = fast = 4`).
- **Count the nodes**:
  - `fast = 5`, count = 1.
  - `fast = 3`, count = 2.
  - `fast = 4` (back to `slow`), count = 3.

The loop length is **3**.

---

### **Key Functions and Their Purpose**

#### **1. `findLengthOfLoopLL`**
Calculates the length of the cycle:
```cpp
int findLengthOfLoopLL(Node* slow , Node* fast)
{
    int cnt = 1; // Start count with the current node
    fast = fast->next; // Move fast to the next node

    while(slow != fast) // Traverse until fast meets slow again
    {
        cnt++; // Increment the count
        fast = fast->next; // Move fast to the next node
    }

    return cnt; // Return the total count
}
```

---

#### **2. `lengthOfLoop`**
Detects the cycle and calculates the length if a loop exists:
```cpp
int lengthOfLoop(Node *head) 
{
    Node* slow = head; // Slow pointer starts at head
    Node* fast = head; // Fast pointer starts at head

    while(fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) // Check fast and fast->next are not NULL
    {
        slow = slow->next;            // Move slow by 1 step
        fast = fast->next->next;      // Move fast by 2 steps

        if(slow == fast) // Loop detected
        {
            return findLengthOfLoopLL(slow, fast); // Calculate loop length
        }
    }

    return 0; // No loop
}
```

---

### **Example Without a Loop**
For a linked list:
```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
```
- `slow` and `fast` traverse the list, but `fast` reaches `NULL`.
- The function returns `0` (no loop).

---

### **Dry Run Table**

Let’s track the values for the looped example:

| **Iteration** | `slow`   | `fast`   | Comment                       |
|---------------|----------|----------|-------------------------------|
| 1             | `2`      | `3`      | Moving pointers               |
| 2             | `3`      | `5`      | Moving pointers               |
| 3             | `4`      | `4`      | Loop detected, pointers meet  |

---

**Loop Traversal for Length**:

| **Iteration** | `fast`   | `count`  | Comment                       |
|---------------|----------|----------|-------------------------------|
| 1             | `5`      | `1`      | Counting nodes in the loop    |
| 2             | `3`      | `2`      | Moving through the loop       |
| 3             | `4`      | `3`      | Back to start, loop length = 3|

---

### **Final Output**
For the given example, the length of the loop is `3`.
