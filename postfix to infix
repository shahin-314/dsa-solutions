### ðŸ”¹ **Understanding the Code in Detail (Indian English Style)**
Let's break it down properly, so even if you see this later, you will **understand everything clearly**. ðŸ’¡

---

### **What is `c` in the Code?**
- `c` is just a **character variable** that stores **each character** of the given postfix expression **one by one** as we loop through it.
- It helps us **check whether a character is an operand (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) or an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)**.

Example:
```cpp
for (char c : postfix) {  
    // 'c' takes one character at a time from postfix expression
}
```

If **postfix = `"ab+c+"`**, the loop runs like this:
| Iteration | `c` (current character) |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| 1st       | `'a'` |
| 2nd       | `'b'` |
| 3rd       | `'+'` |
| 4th       | `'c'` |
| 5th       | `'+'` |

---

### **What is `string operand(1, c);` Doing?**
```cpp
string operand(1, c);
```
- This line **converts the single character `c` into a string** and stores it in `operand`.
- The `string` constructor **string(n, c)** creates a string with `n` copies of character `c`.
- **Here, `n = 1`**, so it makes a **single-character string** from `c`.

ðŸ’¡ **Example:**
```cpp
char c = 'a';
string operand(1, c);  // Creates "a"
```
ðŸ“Œ **Without this, `c` would just be a character, but we need a string because we are working with expressions.**  

---

### **Why `operand2` is Taken First?**
These lines:
```cpp
string operand2 = st.top(); st.pop(); 
string operand1 = st.top(); st.pop();
```
- First, we **pop the topmost element** (`operand2`).
- Then, we **pop the second element** (`operand1`).
- **Order matters** because **in postfix notation, the operator applies to the last two operands pushed**.

ðŸ’¡ **Example:**  
Letâ€™s say the stack contains:
```
["a", "b", "c"]
```
Now, we get `+` (addition operator). The last two elements (`b` and `c`) should be combined first:
1. `operand2 = c`
2. `operand1 = b`
3. New expression: `(b+c)`

ðŸ“Œ **So, `operand2` is taken first because it was pushed later in the stack (LIFO - Last In First Out).**

---

### âœ… **Final Code with Detailed Comments**
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

string postToInfix(string postfix) {
    stack<string> st;  // Stack to store intermediate infix expressions

    for (char c : postfix) { // Loop through each character in the postfix expression
        if (isalnum(c)) {  // If it's an operand (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), push it as a string
            string operand(1, c);  // Convert character to string
            st.push(operand);
        } 
        else {  // If it's an operator, pop two operands from the stack
            string operand2 = st.top(); st.pop();  // Get last operand
            string operand1 = st.top(); st.pop();  // Get second last operand

            // Form new infix expression by placing operator between operands
            string newExpr = "(" + operand1 + c + operand2 + ")";
            st.push(newExpr);  // Push the new expression back into the stack
        }
    }

    return st.top();  // The final infix expression is the last item in stack
}
```

### **ðŸ”¹ Dry Run with Example**
ðŸ“Œ **Input:** `"ab+c+"`  
ðŸ“Œ **Stack Step-by-Step Execution**  

| Step | `c` | Stack State |
|------|-----|------------|
| 1st  | `'a'` | `["a"]` |
| 2nd  | `'b'` | `["a", "b"]` |
| 3rd  | `'+'` | `["(a+b)"]` |
| 4th  | `'c'` | `["(a+b)", "c"]` |
| 5th  | `'+'` | `["((a+b)+c)"]` |

ðŸ“Œ **Output:** `"((a+b)+c)"` âœ…  

---

### **ðŸ’¡ Summary**
1. **`c` stores one character at a time** while looping.
2. **`string operand(1, c);` converts a single character into a string** so we can push it into the stack.
3. **Stack follows LIFO (Last In, First Out), so operand2 is popped first, then operand1**.
4. **Operators pop two operands, combine them into an infix expression, and push back**.
5. **Final expression in the stack is the result.**

Now you have **full clarity** about the **flow of values** and how the **conversion works**! ðŸš€  
Hope this explanation feels like a **friend teaching you**. If anything is still confusing, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
