### **Got it! Letâ€™s go step-by-step to understand this code**  
I will explain the problem, code, dry run, and flow in **simple and easy Indian English accent** with an example and diagrams.

### **Problem Statement**

You need to delete **all occurrences** of a given value (`k`) from a **doubly linked list**.  
A **doubly linked list** has nodes with three parts:
1. A **data** value.
2. A pointer to the **next node**.
3. A pointer to the **previous node**.

---

### **Example**

**Input Doubly Linked List**:  
`2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 3 <-> 5`  

**Value to Delete (`k`)**: `3`  

**Output**:  
`2 <-> 4 <-> 5`

---

### **Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code**

Here is the code with detailed comments for understanding:

```cpp
Node* deleteAllOccurrences(Node* head, int k) 
{
    Node* temp = head; // Start traversing from the head of the list

    while(temp != NULL) // Traverse the list until you reach the end
    {
        if(temp->data == k) // Check if the current node's data is equal to k
        {
            if(temp == head) // If the node to delete is the head
            {
                head = temp->next; // Move the head to the next node
            }

            Node* nextnode = temp->next; // Store the next node
            Node* prevnode = temp->prev; // Store the previous node

            // Adjust the pointers of the next and previous nodes
            if(nextnode != NULL) nextnode->prev = prevnode;
            if(prevnode != NULL) prevnode->next = nextnode;

            delete(temp); // Delete the current node
            temp = nextnode; // Move to the next node
        }
        else
        {
            temp = temp->next; // Move to the next node if data is not equal to k
        }
    }

    return head; // Return the updated head
}
```

### **How the Code Works**

1. **Traversal**: Start from the head of the list and check every nodeâ€™s data.
2. **Deletion**:
   - If the current node's data matches `k`, delete it.
   - Adjust the pointers of the previous and next nodes to bypass the deleted node.
3. **Head Update**: If the head node is deleted, update the head pointer to the next node.
4. **Continue**: Move to the next node and repeat until the end of the list.

### **Example Walkthrough**

Letâ€™s dry-run the code with the following doubly linked list:

**Initial List**:  
`2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 3 <-> 5`  

**Value to Delete (`k`)**: `3`  

---

#### **Step 1: Start with the first node (`2`)**
- `temp = 2`  
- `temp->data != k` (2 is not equal to 3).  
- Move to the next node.  
- **Current List**: `2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 3 <-> 5`

---

#### **Step 2: Check the second node (`3`)**
- `temp = 3`  
- `temp->data == k` (3 is equal to 3).  
  - Update pointers:
    - `prev = 2`, `next = 4`.  
    - `2->next = 4`, `4->prev = 2`.
  - Delete the current node (`3`).  
  - Move to the next node (`4`).  
- **Current List**: `2 <-> 4 <-> 3 <-> 5`

---

#### **Step 3: Check the third node (`4`)**
- `temp = 4`  
- `temp->data != k` (4 is not equal to 3).  
- Move to the next node.  
- **Current List**: `2 <-> 4 <-> 3 <-> 5`

---

#### **Step 4: Check the fourth node (`3`)**
- `temp = 3`  
- `temp->data == k` (3 is equal to 3).  
  - Update pointers:
    - `prev = 4`, `next = 5`.  
    - `4->next = 5`, `5->prev = 4`.  
  - Delete the current node (`3`).  
  - Move to the next node (`5`).  
- **Current List**: `2 <-> 4 <-> 5`

---

#### **Step 5: Check the fifth node (`5`)**
- `temp = 5`  
- `temp->data != k` (5 is not equal to 3).  
- Move to the next node.  
- **Current List**: `2 <-> 4 <-> 5`

---

#### **Step 6: End of the List**
- `temp = NULL`  
- Stop the loop.  

---

### **Final Output**
After deleting all occurrences of `3`:  
`2 <-> 4 <-> 5`

---

### **Flow of Values**
At each step:
1. **`temp`**: Tracks the current node being processed.
2. **`prevnode` and `nextnode`**: Adjust the links to skip over the node being deleted.
3. **`head`**: Updated if the head node is deleted.

---

### **Edge Cases**

1. **List is Empty**:  
   - Input: `head = NULL`, `k = 3`.  
   - Output: `head = NULL`.  

2. **Delete All Nodes**:  
   - Input: `2 <-> 2 <-> 2`, `k = 2`.  
   - Output: Empty list (`NULL`).  

3. **Delete Head Only**:  
   - Input: `3 <-> 4 <-> 5`, `k = 3`.  
   - Output: `4 <-> 5`.  

4. **No Occurrences**:  
   - Input: `2 <-> 4 <-> 5`, `k = 3`.  
   - Output: `2 <-> 4 <-> 5`.
