Alright, let's break down this code step-by-step, making it easy to understand for a beginner.

**1. Include Libraries:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;
```

* **`#include <iostream>`:** This line brings in the tools we need for input and output (like printing to the console, although we're not using it here).
* **`#include <vector>`:** This line lets us use `vector`, which is like a flexible list of numbers.
* **`#include <algorithm>`:** This line gives us the `sort` function, which we'll use to arrange numbers in order.
* **`using namespace std;`:** This makes it easier to use things from the standard C++ library without having to type `std::` before them.

**2. Create a Class:**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // ... code inside the class ...
};
```

* **`class Solution { ... };`:** This creates a blueprint (a class) called `Solution`. Classes are used to group data and functions together.
* **`public:`:** This means that the function inside the class can be used from outside the class.

**3. Define the Function:**

```cpp
vector<int> sortEvenOdd(vector<int>& nums) {
    // ... function code ...
}
```

* **`vector<int> sortEvenOdd(vector<int>& nums)`:** This defines a function called `sortEvenOdd`.
    * **`vector<int>`:** This means the function will return a list of numbers.
    * **`vector<int>& nums`:** This is the input to the function. It's a list of numbers, and the `&` means we'll be changing the original list that's passed in.

**4. Create Empty Lists:**

```cpp
vector<int> odd;
vector<int> even;
```

* **`vector<int> odd;`** and **`vector<int> even;`:** We create two empty lists to store the numbers from the `nums` list. `odd` will hold the numbers at odd positions, and `even` will hold the numbers at even positions.

**5. Separate Numbers by Position:**

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
        even.push_back(nums[i]);
    } else {
        odd.push_back(nums[i]);
    }
}
```

* **`for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i)`:** This loop goes through each number in the `nums` list.
    * `i` starts at 0 and goes up to the last position in the list.
* **`if (i % 2 == 0)`:** This checks if the position (`i`) is even.
    * `%` gives the remainder when you divide. If the remainder when `i` is divided by 2 is 0, then `i` is even.
* **`even.push_back(nums[i]);`:** If the position is even, we add the number at that position (`nums[i]`) to the `even` list.
* **`else { odd.push_back(nums[i]); }`:** If the position is odd, we add the number to the `odd` list.

**6. Sort the Lists:**

```cpp
sort(odd.begin(), odd.end(), greater<int>());
sort(even.begin(), even.end());
```

* **`sort(odd.begin(), odd.end(), greater<int>());`:** This sorts the `odd` list.
    * `odd.begin()` and `odd.end()` tell the `sort` function where the list starts and ends.
    * `greater<int>()` tells it to sort the numbers from biggest to smallest.
* **`sort(even.begin(), even.end());`:** This sorts the `even` list from smallest to biggest (the default way `sort` works).

**7. Put Numbers Back into the Original List:**

```cpp
int oddIndex = 0;
int evenIndex = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
        nums[i] = even[evenIndex++];
    } else {
        nums[i] = odd[oddIndex++];
    }
}
```

* **`int oddIndex = 0;`** and **`int evenIndex = 0;`:** We create two counters to keep track of where we are in the `odd` and `even` lists.
* **`for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i)`:** We go through each position in the original `nums` list again.
* **`if (i % 2 == 0)`:** If the position is even, we take the next number from the sorted `even` list and put it into `nums[i]`.
    * `even[evenIndex++]` gets the number and then increases `evenIndex` by 1.
* **`else { nums[i] = odd[oddIndex++]; }`:** If the position is odd, we take the next number from the sorted `odd` list and put it into `nums[i]`.

**8. Return the Modified List:**

```cpp
return nums;
```

* **`return nums;`:** We return the `nums` list, which now has the numbers in the required order.

**In Simple Terms:**

1. **Split:** Take the original list and split it into two lists: one for numbers at even positions and one for numbers at odd positions.
2. **Sort:** Sort the even-position list from smallest to biggest and the odd-position list from biggest to smallest.
3. **Merge:** Put the sorted numbers back into the original list in the correct order.
4. **Return:** Give back the modified list.
