Got it! Let me explain the entire code properly in a detailed and **systematic manner**, step-by-step, exactly as you want. I'll make it **easy**, include **examples**, and dry-run it fully.

---

### **What is this code doing?**
The function **removes the K-th node from the end** of a linked list. The code achieves this efficiently in one pass using two pointers (`slow` and `fast`). 

---

### **How does it work?**
1. Move the `fast` pointer `K` steps ahead from the start.
2. Simultaneously move both `slow` and `fast` pointers until `fast` reaches the end of the list.
3. At this point, the `slow` pointer is just before the node that needs to be removed.
4. Update the `next` pointer of `slow` to skip the K-th node from the end.
5. If `fast` becomes `NULL` immediately after the initial K steps, the head itself is the node to be removed.

---

### **Code Explanation**

#### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**
Letâ€™s look at each line of code:

```cpp
Node* removeKthNode(Node* head, int K)
{
    Node* slow = head; // Slow pointer starts at the head
    Node* fast = head; // Fast pointer also starts at the head
```
- Two pointers are initialized at the head of the list.

---

```cpp
    for (int i = 0; i < K; i++) 
        fast = fast->next;
```
- Move `fast` pointer `K` steps forward. This ensures that when `fast` reaches the end, `slow` will be just before the node to be removed.

---

```cpp
    if (fast == NULL) 
        return head->next;
```
- If `fast` becomes `NULL` after moving `K` steps, it means the list has exactly `K` nodes, and the head node needs to be removed. So, return `head->next`.

---

```cpp
    while (fast->next != NULL)
    {
        slow = slow->next; // Move slow one step forward
        fast = fast->next; // Move fast one step forward
    }
```
- Move both pointers one step at a time until `fast` reaches the last node. At this point, `slow` will be just before the K-th node from the end.

---

```cpp
    Node* deleteNode = slow->next;       // Save the node to be deleted
    slow->next = slow->next->next;      // Skip the K-th node
    free(deleteNode);                   // Free the memory of the deleted node
    return head;                        // Return the updated head
```
- Remove the K-th node by skipping it in the list.

---

### **Flow of the Code with Example**

#### Example Input
Linked list: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`, `K = 2`.

#### **Dry Run**

1. **Initialization**:
   - `slow = 1`, `fast = 1`

---

2. **Move `fast` K steps ahead**:
   - Step 1: `fast = 2`
   - Step 2: `fast = 3`

---

3. **Move both pointers until `fast` reaches the end**:
   - Iteration 1: `slow = 2`, `fast = 4`
   - Iteration 2: `slow = 3`, `fast = 5` (end reached)

---

4. **Delete the K-th node from the end**:
   - `slow->next` is pointing to `4` (the node to be removed).
   - Update `slow->next` to `slow->next->next` (i.e., `3 -> 5`).

---

**Final Linked List**:
`1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5`.

---

### **Diagram Representation**

#### Original List:
```
head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
                     ^    ^
                   slow  fast
```

#### After Deletion:
```
head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -----> 5
```

---

### **Edge Cases**

1. **K = 1 (Remove last node)**:
   - Input: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`, `K = 1`.
   - Output: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`.

2. **K = Length of the List (Remove the head)**:
   - Input: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`, `K = 5`.
   - Output: `2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`.

3. **Single Node List (Remove the only node)**:
   - Input: `1`, `K = 1`.
   - Output: `NULL`.

---

### **Why is this Efficient?**
- The code uses only **one traversal** of the linked list, so the time complexity is **O(n)**.
- No extra space is used, so the space complexity is **O(1)**.

---

### **Final Output**
For the example list `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5` and `K = 2`, the function returns:
```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5
```
