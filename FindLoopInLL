Got it! I will explain everything step by step, in a simple and easy way, as if I am teaching you for the first time. I will break down the explanation of the **cycle detection in a linked list** using the **Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm**. I'll also walk you through the code and how it works in detail.

### Problem Statement:
We are given a **singly linked list**, and we need to **check if there is a cycle** in it. A cycle means that a node's `next` pointer points back to a previous node in the list, creating an infinite loop.

For example:
1. **No Cycle:** 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → NULL
2. **With Cycle:** 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 2 (where 4 points back to 2)

### What we need to do:
We need to detect if there’s a cycle in the linked list. If a cycle exists, return `true`; if not, return `false`.

### Code Explanation:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) 
    {
        // Step 1: Create two pointers: slow and fast
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head;

        // Step 2: Traverse the list with two pointers
        while(fast != NULL && fast -> next != NULL)
        {
            // Step 3: Move slow pointer by 1 step and fast pointer by 2 steps
            slow = slow -> next;
            fast = fast -> next -> next;

            // Step 4: If slow and fast meet, there is a cycle
            if(slow == fast) return true;
        }

        // Step 5: If fast reaches the end (NULL), there is no cycle
        return false;
    }
};
```

### Detailed Explanation:

#### Step 1: Initialization
- We start with two pointers:
  - **slow**: This pointer will move one step at a time.
  - **fast**: This pointer will move two steps at a time.

We initialize both pointers to the **head** of the linked list.

#### Step 2: Traverse the List
We run a loop with the condition that **both fast and fast->next should not be NULL**. This ensures that we don't try to access an invalid `next` pointer.

#### Step 3: Move Pointers
- **Slow pointer moves by 1 step:** This means that slow moves from the current node to the next node.
- **Fast pointer moves by 2 steps:** This means fast jumps two nodes ahead.

#### Step 4: Cycle Detection
If there's a cycle in the list, the slow pointer and fast pointer will eventually meet inside the cycle because the fast pointer is moving faster and will eventually "catch up" to the slow pointer.

#### Step 5: No Cycle
If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list (i.e., `fast == NULL` or `fast->next == NULL`), it means the list doesn't have a cycle.

### Example:

Let's take an example to demonstrate how the pointers move:

#### Example 1: **No Cycle**
Consider the list: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → NULL

- Initially, both slow and fast are at node 1.
  
  ```
  slow = 1
  fast = 1
  ```

- In the first iteration:
  - Slow moves one step → slow moves to 2.
  - Fast moves two steps → fast moves to 3.
  
  ```
  slow = 2
  fast = 3
  ```

- In the second iteration:
  - Slow moves one step → slow moves to 3.
  - Fast moves two steps → fast moves to NULL (end of list).
  
  ```
  slow = 3
  fast = NULL
  ```

- The loop exits because `fast == NULL`, meaning the list has no cycle. The function returns `false`.

#### Example 2: **With Cycle**
Consider the list: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 2 (where 4 points back to 2)

- Initially, both slow and fast are at node 1.

  ```
  slow = 1
  fast = 1
  ```

- In the first iteration:
  - Slow moves one step → slow moves to 2.
  - Fast moves two steps → fast moves to 3.

  ```
  slow = 2
  fast = 3
  ```

- In the second iteration:
  - Slow moves one step → slow moves to 3.
  - Fast moves two steps → fast moves to 2 (due to cycle).

  ```
  slow = 3
  fast = 2
  ```

- In the third iteration:
  - Slow moves one step → slow moves to 4.
  - Fast moves two steps → fast moves to 4.

  ```
  slow = 4
  fast = 4
  ```

- Now both slow and fast pointers meet at node 4. This means there is a cycle in the list. The function returns `true`.

### Code Dry Run (Step by Step):

1. **First Iteration:**
   - Slow = 1, Fast = 1.
   - Slow moves 1 step → Slow = 2.
   - Fast moves 2 steps → Fast = 3.

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - Slow = 2, Fast = 3.
   - Slow moves 1 step → Slow = 3.
   - Fast moves 2 steps → Fast = NULL.

3. **Exit Condition:**
   - Fast is NULL, so the loop ends.
   - No cycle is found, return `false`.

### What Happens in the Case of a Cycle?

#### Example of a Cycle (1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 2):

- Slow starts at 1 and fast starts at 1.
- In the first iteration:
  - Slow moves to 2, Fast moves to 3.
- In the second iteration:
  - Slow moves to 3, Fast moves to 2.
- In the third iteration:
  - Slow moves to 4, Fast moves to 4.
- Slow and Fast meet at 4 → Cycle detected, return `true`.

### Why This Works:
The reason this method works is that:
- **Fast pointer moves quicker**, so if there is a cycle, it will eventually "lap" the slow pointer and both will meet inside the cycle.
- **If there's no cycle**, the fast pointer will eventually reach the end (NULL), and the slow pointer will never meet it.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)** where `n` is the number of nodes in the list. This is because both slow and fast pointers travel through the list at most once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)** since we are only using two extra pointers (slow and fast) and not using any extra data structures.

---

### Conclusion:
- The code works by using two pointers: slow (moves 1 step) and fast (moves 2 steps). If there’s a cycle, they’ll eventually meet. If there’s no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end.
- The process is efficient, and this algorithm works in linear time with constant space usage.

Hope this helps!
