### ✅ **Bubble Sort Explained in an Easy Way**

---

### 💡 **What is Bubble Sort?**  
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm where **we repeatedly compare two adjacent elements** and **swap them if they are in the wrong order**.  
- This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.  
- Imagine **bubbles rising to the top of water**—the largest elements "bubble up" to the end of the array with each pass.

### 🚀 **Step-by-Step Example**

Let's say we have an array:  
```
arr = [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]
```

1️⃣ **First Pass (i = 0):**  
- Compare `5` and `3` → **Swap** → `[3, 5, 8, 4, 2]`  
- Compare `5` and `8` → No swap  
- Compare `8` and `4` → **Swap** → `[3, 5, 4, 8, 2]`  
- Compare `8` and `2` → **Swap** → `[3, 5, 4, 2, 8]`  
✅ The largest element `8` is now at the correct position.

2️⃣ **Second Pass (i = 1):**  
- Compare `3` and `5` → No swap  
- Compare `5` and `4` → **Swap** → `[3, 4, 5, 2, 8]`  
- Compare `5` and `2` → **Swap** → `[3, 4, 2, 5, 8]`  
✅ Second-largest element `5` is now in place.

3️⃣ **Third Pass (i = 2):**  
- Compare `3` and `4` → No swap  
- Compare `4` and `2` → **Swap** → `[3, 2, 4, 5, 8]`

4️⃣ **Fourth Pass (i = 3):**  
- Compare `3` and `2` → **Swap** → `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`  
✅ Now the array is fully sorted!

### 🎯 **Why Use `bool swapped`?**

The `swapped` variable helps to **optimize** Bubble Sort.  
- **Without `swapped`:** The algorithm will make all `n-1` passes even if the array is already sorted, which is unnecessary.  
- **With `swapped`:** If no elements were swapped in a pass, it means the array is already sorted, and we can **break early** to save time.

---

### ⚡ **Can We Skip `bool swapped`?**

Yes, **we can skip it**, but the algorithm will become **less efficient** because:  
- It will **continue checking even when the array is sorted**.  
- This wastes time, especially for large arrays.

---

### 🔍 **Version Without `swapped` (Less Efficient):**

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void bubbleSort(vector<int>& arr, int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                swap(arr[j], arr[j + 1]); // Swap without checking for early termination
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- **Time Complexity:** Always `O(n²)`  
- **Drawback:** Even if the array is already sorted, it will still go through all the loops.

---

### 🔑 **Conclusion:**  
- **For learning purposes, both versions are fine.**  
- **For better performance, use the `swapped` variable** to make Bubble Sort faster on nearly sorted arrays.
