Sure! I’ll explain everything step by step in a simple and easy-to-understand way, like how I would explain it to someone just starting with coding. Let’s break it down slowly, step-by-step, and I’ll make sure to explain the code and the concept clearly using an example, so you can understand how everything works.

### Problem Understanding:

The problem you are solving is to **find all possible subsets** of a given list of integers. A **subset** is just a collection of elements from the list. The key point is that:
1. **Subsets can be of any size** (including empty subset).
2. **The order doesn't matter** in the subsets (e.g., [1, 2] is the same as [2, 1]).

For example:
- If the input is `[1, 2, 3]`, the output should be all possible subsets:
  ```
  [], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]
  ```

---

### Approach:

To generate all subsets, we will use **Recursion** (a function calling itself) and **Backtracking** (going back and exploring different possibilities).

- **Recursion** will help us explore every possible subset one by one.
- **Backtracking** will ensure that once we have explored one possibility, we go back and explore the next one by removing the last added element from the subset.

### Code Explanation:

Here is the code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Backtracking function to generate subsets
void backtrack(int index, vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& current, vector<vector<int>>& result) {
    // Add the current subset to the result
    result.push_back(current);
    
    // Try adding each element after the current index
    for (int i = index; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        // Include nums[i] in the subset
        current.push_back(nums[i]);
        
        // Recur for the next elements
        backtrack(i + 1, nums, current, result);
        
        // Exclude nums[i] from the subset (backtrack)
        current.pop_back();
    }
}

// Main function to return all subsets
vector<vector<int>> pwset(vector<int>& v) {
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    vector<int> current; // Empty subset initially
    backtrack(0, v, current, result); // Start recursion from index 0
    return result;
}
```

### **Step-by-Step Explanation of Code:**

1. **Main Function: `pwset`**
   - This is the starting point of our program. It takes a vector `v` as input (the list of numbers).
   - We create an empty vector `current`, which will store the current subset.
   - We call the `backtrack` function to start the recursion, passing the starting index `0` (since we start from the first element).

2. **Backtracking Function: `backtrack`**
   - This function does the main work of generating the subsets. Here's how:
     - **`result.push_back(current);`**: Add the current subset to the list of all subsets.
     - **Loop through the elements**: We start at the `index` and loop through all elements.
     - **Include the current element in the subset**: `current.push_back(nums[i]);`
     - **Recursively call the function**: We call the `backtrack` function again with the next index `i + 1` to explore the next possible subset.
     - **Backtrack**: After we’ve explored the current path (including `nums[i]`), we remove it (`current.pop_back()`), so we can try the next element without it.

### **Dry Run with Example:**

Let’s take an example to see how the code works. We’ll use `nums = [1, 2, 3]`.

1. **Start with an empty subset** `current = []` and the first index `index = 0`.

---

#### **Iteration 1:**

- **Step 1:** `index = 0`, `current = []`
  - Add the empty set to the result: `result = [[]]`
  
- **Step 2:** Now, loop through the elements starting from index 0.

  1. **Include `nums[0] = 1`**:
     - `current = [1]`
     - Call `backtrack(1, [1, 2, 3], [1], result)` to explore the next element.
  
#### **Iteration 2:**

- **Step 1:** `index = 1`, `current = [1]`
  - Add `[1]` to the result: `result = [[], [1]]`
  
- **Step 2:** Now, loop through the elements starting from index 1.

  1. **Include `nums[1] = 2`**:
     - `current = [1, 2]`
     - Call `backtrack(2, [1, 2, 3], [1, 2], result)` to explore the next element.
     
#### **Iteration 3:**

- **Step 1:** `index = 2`, `current = [1, 2]`
  - Add `[1, 2]` to the result: `result = [[], [1], [1, 2]]`
  
- **Step 2:** Now, loop through the elements starting from index 2.

  1. **Include `nums[2] = 3`**:
     - `current = [1, 2, 3]`
     - Call `backtrack(3, [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], result)` to explore further, but no elements left.

#### **Base Case Reached:**
- `index = 3`, the loop ends, so we backtrack:
  - Remove `3` from `current` to get `[1, 2]` again.
  - Return to the previous level.

#### **Backtracking:**
- Remove `2` from `current` to get `[1]`.
- **Next, include `nums[2] = 3`**: `current = [1, 3]`
- Add `[1, 3]` to the result: `result = [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3]]`

#### **Continue Backtracking:**

- Backtrack again, remove `1` from `current` to get `[]`.
- **Next, include `nums[1] = 2`**: `current = [2]`
- Add `[2]` to the result: `result = [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2]]`
  
- **Include `nums[2] = 3`**: `current = [2, 3]`
- Add `[2, 3]` to the result: `result = [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3]]`

#### **Backtrack Again:**

- Finally, remove `2` and `3` from `current` and **include `nums[2] = 3`**: `current = [3]`
- Add `[3]` to the result: `result = [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3]]`

---

### **Final Result:**
After all the backtracking and recursion, we will have:
```
[[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3]]
```

---

### **Key Points to Remember:**
1. **Backtracking**: We go deeper by including an element, and when we reach the end or a base case, we backtrack by removing the element and explore other possibilities.
2. **Recursion**: Each recursive call explores the next element, either including or excluding it in the subset.
3. **Result**: At each recursive call, we store the current subset in the result, which helps us build all subsets.

---

### Conclusion:

This is a simple and efficient way to generate all subsets using recursion and backtracking. The approach systematically explores each possibility, making sure that every subset is considered.

By using recursion, we ensure that we go deep into each subset, and by backtracking, we ensure we return to explore other possibilities.

Let me know if anything is unclear, and I’ll be happy to explain further!
