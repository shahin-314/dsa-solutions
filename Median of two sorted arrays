Alright, let’s break this down step by step in a simple way, just like how we’d explain it over a cup of chai.

### Problem Statement
The problem here is to find the median of two sorted arrays, `a` and `b`. The median is the middle value when you have an ordered list of numbers. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If it has an even number, it’s the average of the two middle values.

### Code Explanation
Let’s look at the code and understand it with comments.

```cpp
double median(vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) 
{
    vector<int> arr3; // This will store the merged array
    int n1 = a.size(), n2 = b.size(); // Get sizes of both arrays
    int i = 0; // Index for array a
    int j = 0; // Index for array b
    
    // Merge both arrays while maintaining sorted order
    while(i < n1 && j < n2)
    {
        if(a[i] < b[j]) 
            arr3.push_back(a[i++]); // Add a[i] to arr3 and move i forward
        else 
            arr3.push_back(b[j++]); // Add b[j] to arr3 and move j forward
    }

    // If any elements left in a, add them
    while(i < n1) 
        arr3.push_back(a[i++]);

    // If any elements left in b, add them
    while(j < n2) 
        arr3.push_back(b[j++]);

    int n = (n1 + n2); // Total number of elements in the merged array

    // If total number of elements is odd
    if(n % 2 == 1)
    {
        return arr3[n / 2]; // Return the middle element
    }

    // If total number of elements is even
    return (double)((double)(arr3[n / 2]) + (double)(arr3[n / 2 - 1])) / 2.0; // Return average of two middle elements
}
```

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough with an Example
Let’s say we have two arrays:
- `a = [1, 3]`
- `b = [2]`

**Step 1: Merging Arrays**
- Start with empty `arr3`, `i = 0`, `j = 0`.
- Compare `a[0] (1)` and `b[0] (2)`. Since `1 < 2`, add `1` to `arr3` and increment `i`.
- Now, `arr3 = [1]`, `i = 1`, `j = 0`.
- Compare `a[1] (3)` and `b[0] (2)`. Now, `2 < 3`, so add `2` to `arr3` and increment `j`.
- Now, `arr3 = [1, 2]`, `i = 1`, `j = 1`.
- Since `j` is out of bounds, add the remaining elements from `a`.
- Finally, `arr3 = [1, 2, 3]`.

**Step 2: Finding the Median**
- Total elements in `arr3 = 3` (which is odd).
- So, the median is `arr3[n/2]`, which is `arr3[3/2] = arr3[1] = 2`.

### Another Example
Now, let’s take another example where both arrays have an even total number of elements.
- `a = [1, 2]`
- `b = [3, 4]`

**Merging Process**
- Compare `1` and `3`, add `1` to `arr3`.
- Compare `2` and `3`, add `2`.
- Now, `arr3 = [1, 2]`, then add remaining elements from `b`, so `arr3 = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.

**Finding the Median**
- Total elements = 4 (which is even).
- The two middle elements are `arr3[1] = 2` and `arr3[2] = 3`.
- So, the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

### Summary
This code effectively merges two sorted arrays and then finds the median by checking if the total number of elements is odd or even. It runs through both arrays once, making it efficient.

### Flow of Code
1. Initialize the merged array and indices.
2. Merge the two arrays by comparing elements.
3. If any elements are left in either array, add them.
4. Calculate the total number of elements.
5. Based on whether the count is odd or even, return the median.

By this way, you can clearly see how the merging happens and how the median is calculated based on different scenarios. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask!
