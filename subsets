Let me explain the code step by step in the **simplest way possible**, keeping in mind that youâ€™re a beginner. ðŸ˜Š

### **What does the code do?**
This code generates all possible subsets (or power sets) of a given array `nums`.

For example:
- If `nums = [1, 2, 3]`, the subsets will be:
  `[[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]`.
- The code does this using **bit manipulation** to efficiently calculate subsets.

---

### **Breaking Down the Code**

#### 1. **Understanding Key Variables**
- **`n = nums.size();`**
  - `n` is the size of the array `nums`.
  - For example, if `nums = [1, 2, 3]`, then `n = 3`.

- **`totalSubsets = 1 << n;`**
  - `1 << n` calculates `2^n`, which is the total number of subsets.
  - Why `2^n`?
    - Each number in `nums` can either be included or excluded in a subset.  
    - So, for `n` numbers, there are `2^n` combinations (subsets).

#### 2. **Initializing Result Storage**
- **`vector<vector<int>> result(totalSubsets);`**
  - Pre-allocate memory for all subsets.  
  - This means `result` will eventually hold all subsets of `nums`.

#### 3. **Outer Loop (`i`): Generating All Subsets**
- **`for (int i = 0; i < totalSubsets; i++) {`**
  - `i` is a number representing a subset in binary.
  - For example:
    - `i = 0` â†’ Subset: `[]` (no elements selected).  
    - `i = 1` â†’ Subset: `[1]` (select first element).  
    - `i = 2` â†’ Subset: `[2]` (select second element).  
    - `i = 3` â†’ Subset: `[1, 2]` (select first and second elements), and so on.

#### 4. **Inner Loop (`j`): Checking Which Elements to Include**
- **`for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {`**
  - This loop checks each bit of `i` to decide if `nums[j]` should be included in the subset.

#### 5. **The If Condition**
Now comes the heart of the code:
```cpp
if (i & (1 << j)) {
    result[i].push_back(nums[j]);
}
```

---

### **Explaining the If Condition**
This condition determines **whether to include `nums[j]` in the current subset**.

#### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**
1. **`(1 << j)`**: 
   - Creates a number where only the `j`th bit is set to `1`.
   - Example:
     - For `j = 0`: `1 << 0 = 0001` â†’ Represents the first bit.
     - For `j = 1`: `1 << 1 = 0010` â†’ Represents the second bit.
     - For `j = 2`: `1 << 2 = 0100` â†’ Represents the third bit.

2. **`i & (1 << j)`**:  
   - Performs a bitwise AND between `i` and `(1 << j)`.  
   - This checks if the `j`th bit in `i` is `1`.
   - If true, it means `nums[j]` should be included in the current subset.

3. **Result of the If Condition**:  
   - If `i & (1 << j)` is **non-zero**, it means the `j`th bit is set in `i`.
   - **Include `nums[j]`** in the current subset.

### **Example: nums = [1, 2, 3]**

#### Dry Run with `nums = [1, 2, 3]`
We calculate subsets for all `i` from `0` to `7` (`2^3 = 8` subsets).

| `i`  (binary) | Subset Representation (binary) | Resulting Subset |
|---------------|--------------------------------|------------------|
| `000`         | No bits set (empty subset)     | `[]`             |
| `001`         | 1st bit set â†’ include `1`      | `[1]`            |
| `010`         | 2nd bit set â†’ include `2`      | `[2]`            |
| `011`         | 1st & 2nd bits set â†’ include `1, 2` | `[1, 2]`    |
| `100`         | 3rd bit set â†’ include `3`      | `[3]`            |
| `101`         | 1st & 3rd bits set â†’ include `1, 3` | `[1, 3]`    |
| `110`         | 2nd & 3rd bits set â†’ include `2, 3` | `[2, 3]`    |
| `111`         | All bits set â†’ include `1, 2, 3` | `[1, 2, 3]` |

---

#### Dry Run for `i = 5` (binary `101`)
1. Outer loop: `i = 5` (binary `101`).
2. Inner loop (`j`):
   - `j = 0`:  
     - `(1 << 0) = 0001` â†’ `i & (1 << 0) = 101 & 001 = 001` â†’ Non-zero â†’ Include `nums[0] = 1`.
   - `j = 1`:  
     - `(1 << 1) = 0010` â†’ `i & (1 << 1) = 101 & 010 = 000` â†’ Zero â†’ Do not include `nums[1]`.
   - `j = 2`:  
     - `(1 << 2) = 0100` â†’ `i & (1 << 2) = 101 & 100 = 100` â†’ Non-zero â†’ Include `nums[2] = 3`.

**Result for `i = 5`: Subset = `[1, 3]`**

---

### **Flow of the Code**
1. **Outer Loop**: Loops through all `2^n` possible subsets.
2. **Inner Loop**: For each subset `i`, checks each bit position `j` to decide if `nums[j]` should be included.
3. **If Condition**: Ensures only elements corresponding to set bits in `i` are added to the subset.
4. **Result**: Collects all subsets in the `result` vector.

---

### **Final Output**
For `nums = [1, 2, 3]`, the output will be:
```
[[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
```
